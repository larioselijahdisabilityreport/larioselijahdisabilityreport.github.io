									<p>     <b>During the Great Depression</b>
										<br>
										In the times of the Great Depression, people with intellectual disabilitys were being 
										tormented by people without. They were also being told to kill themselves, which is also 
										how people with other diseases also ended up. (#3)<br>
										Doctors and other people working in the medical field recommended euthanasia for people 
										with intellectual disability (#4) <br>
										They overcame these challenges by having to try their best to do their best and not get in trouble and sent away or put down.</p>
									
									<p> <b>Now</b>
										<br>
										People use name-calling. They also get bullied. This is classified as verbal abuse. Now we have devices and technology to help people with Intellectual Disabilities. They can overcome these challenges by ignoring people around them that are rude to them.
